//## Phase 1: the `House` class
//---
//1. Make the `House` class `extend` the `Building` class, and add the following attributes:
//```
//private ArrayList<String> residents; // The <String> tells Java what kind of data we plan to store IN the ArrayList
//private boolean hasDiningRoom;
//```
//Modify the `House` **constructor** to initialize `residents` to a `new ArrayList<String>()`, as well as to set `hasDiningRoom` to indicate whether or not the house has a dining room. You'll have to pass this value in as a parameter to the constructor, and don't forget to `import java.util.ArrayList`!

//---
//2. Write the following accessors to retrieve the indicated values:
//```
//public boolean hasDiningRoom();
//public int nResidents();
//```

//---
//3. Write methods to update the `ArrayList` of `residents` every time someone moves in or out:
//```
//public void moveIn(String name);
//public String moveOut(String name); // return the name of the person who moved out
//```
//as well as a boolean method that tells us whether or not a given person is a resident of the `House` (for security reasons, we don't want to provide direct access to the entire list of residents):
//```
//public boolean isResident(String person);
//```
//_Hint: use the functions provided by the [`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) class to make this much easier! Specifically, check out `add(...)`, `remove(...)`, and `contains(...)`._
