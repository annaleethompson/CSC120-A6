//  ## Phase 2: the `Library` class
//A `Library` is an altogether different kind of building:

//<img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1596/1596485.png" alt="Library icon created by Freepik - Flaticon" width="200"/>

//In this phase, your task is to expand on the stub contained in `Library.java`. A `Library` doesn't have any `residents` (nor do we have to worry about a dining room), but it does have a `collection` (of titles) which we'll store in another data structure called a `Hashtable`:
//```
//private Hashtable<String, Boolean> collection;
//```
//`Hashtable`s are a way to store `(key, value)` pairs in Java. We'll use store each book's title and author (concatenated together as one `String`, i.e. `"The Lorax by Dr. Seuss"`) as the `key`, and we'll use the corresponding boolean value to record whether or not the book is available (`true`) or currently checked out (`false`).

//---
//1. Make the `Library` class `extend` the `Building` class, add a `private Hashtable<String, boolean> collection` attribute, and initialize this to an empty `Hashtable<String, boolean>` inside the `Library` constructor. Don't forget to `import java.util.Hashtable`!

//---
//2. Write methods to update the `Hashtable` containing the `collection` every time we add/remove a title:
//```
//public void addTitle(String title);
//public String removeTitle(String title); // return the title that we removed
//```
//as well as to check a book out or return it (rather than adding or removing a book from the collection, these methods will simply modify the `value` associated with the given `key` - the `title`):
//```
//public void checkOut(String title);
//public void returnBook(String title);
//```
//_Hint: use the functions provided by the [`Hashtable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html) class to make this much easier! Specifically, check out `put(...)`, `remove(...)`, and `replace(...)`._

//---
//3. For good measure, we'll also write a couple of methods to support browsing the collection:
//```
//public boolean containsTitle(String title); // returns true if the title appears as a key in the Libary's collection, false otherwise
//public boolean isAvailable(String title); // returns true if the title is currently available, false otherwise
//public void printCollection(); // prints out the entire collection in an easy-to-read way (including checkout status)
//```
//_Hint: again, let `Hashtable`'s methods do some of the heavy lifting for you!_
