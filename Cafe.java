//## Phase 3: The `Cafe` class
//Finally, my personal favorite type of building within walking distance of any college campus, the `Cafe`:

//<img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1839/1839053.png" alt="Cafe icon created by Freepik - Flaticon" width="200"/>

//Unlike the `House` and the `Library`, the `Cafe` doesn't need to keep track of a large number of individual things. Instead, it needs to keep track of its inventory, which in this simplified world is just three ingredients and the cups to put them in:

//```
//private int nCoffeeOunces; // The number of ounces of coffee remaining in inventory
//private int nSugarPackets; // The number of sugar packets remaining in inventory
//private int nCreams; // The number of "splashes" of cream remaining in inventory
//private int nCups; // The number of cups remaining in inventory
//```

//---
//1. Make the `Cafe` class `extend` the `Building` class, add the attributes listed above, and modify the `Cafe` constructor to set the starting values of each of the stocked items (coffee, sugar, cream, and cups).

//---
//2. Write a method to decrease the remaining inventory when the `Cafe` sells a cup of coffee:
//```
//public void sellCoffee(int size, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams);
//```
//Each time this method is called, the inventory should decrease in each category according to the given parameters, e.g. calling `myCafe.sellCoffee(12, 2, 3);`
//should decrease the `myCafe` object's `nCoffeeOunces` by 12, `nSugarPackets` by 2, and `nCreams` by 3 (and of course, `nCups` by 1).

//---
//3. And of course, a `Cafe` can't sell what it doesn't have in stock, so let's also write a method to restock when necessary:
//```
//private void restock(int nCoffeeOunces, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams, int nCups); 
//```
//This method will be `private` (since we don't want some random person forcefully restocking the shelves!) - we'll call it from **inside** the `sellCoffee(...)` method, in the event that we don't have enough ingredients in stock to make the requested drink.
